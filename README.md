# spaghetti

## Concept

This game is a loveletter to javascript. It was written vanilla, and runs in the browser with no need for a server or internet connection. All you have to do is download the folder and double click the index file.

You're a cat with a fork. Use the arrow keys to move, "z" is jump, "x" is stab, "s" is wear sunglasses. Moving your mouse gets the cat's attention.

The cat's name is spaghetti. He's named after the style of code his world was written in (:
